SUPPORTED BROWSERS
------------------
All browsers supporting NPAPI plugin API should work.
'npca' supported browsers are newer Gecko-engine browsers (Mozilla, Firefox), Safari (WebKit based).

HOW TO BUILD
------------

1. Edit 'configure/RELEASE' file and set 'EPICS_BASE' variable to reflect your environment.
2. Build plug-in by executing 'make'.

Build plug-in is a dynamic/shared library and does not have EPICS statically linked.
Make sure that EPICS 'ca' and 'Com' are available. Since it uses native EPICS 'ca' library implementation,
'caRepeater' has to be in path (or already loaded).

STATIC BUILD
------------

Linux
-----
Put (uncomment) line

STATIC_BUILD = YES

in npca-plugin/npca/src/Makefile.

Win32
-----
You have to compile whole EPICS base as static.
Change your EPICS_BASE/configure/CONFIG_SITE near line 120 to

SHARED_LIBRARIES=NO
STATIC_BUILD=YES

Whole base would be static (including caRepeater.exe).

Now to build NPCA (which has to be an DLL) turn those switches to

SHARED_LIBRARIES=YES
STATIC_BUILD=YES

or put those lines in the npca-plugin/npca/src/Makefile.

Resulted npca.dll size should ~508kB.



HOW TO INSTALL
--------------

Mac OS X (Darwin)
------------------
A plug-in bundle named 'npca.plugin' is created in 'lib/<arch>' directory. Copy it to your '/Library/Internet Plug-Ins' or '~/Library/Internet Plug-Ins' directory.


Linux
-----
A shared library named 'libnpca.so' is created in 'lib/<arch>' directory. Copy it to your browser's plugins directory.


Win32
-----
A dynamic loadable library named 'npca.dll' is created in 'lib/<arch>' directory. Copy it to your browser's plugins directory.


USAGE
-----
See 'npca/test/test.html', that shows and tests all 'npca' functionality.
