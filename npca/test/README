HOW TO RUN A TEST
-----------------
1. Compile 'npcaTest' softIOC application (set of EPICS_BASE in configure/RELEASE before building):

cd <...>/npca-plugin/npca/test (where this README is located)
cd npcaTest
make

2. Run 'npcaTest' softIOC:

cd iocBoot/iocnpca
./st.cmd

NOTE: you might need to fix first line of the 'st.cmd' and 'ARCH' in the 'Makefile' in the same directory to reflect your environment.

3. 'Open test.html' in your browser.

'test.html' is located in <...>/npca-plugin/npca/test (where this README is located).
